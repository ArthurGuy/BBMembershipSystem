Hi,

You have been setup in the new Build Brighton Member System, this is where your subscription and other
payment related things will be managed.

You can login by visiting the url below and using the password reset option, you will then be sent a link to set a password.

Please spend a moment to do this and take a look at your details, I have done my best to import everything
from the various places it used to live but some of it will probably not be right.

This system is also tracking equipment training, we don't have a very good record of this so if you have already
been trained on something or paid for the training please send me an email with the details and I will make the updates.

The other important thing is the payment method. This system is designed to work with direct debits as its primary method,
this system is fully integerated and works well. Standing orders are a pain to track and PayPal is expensive so we would like
everyone with a UK bank account to switch over to a direct debit. This is really easy and can be done from the admin
system by following the prompts.

If you have any questions please get in touch with me or the trustees.

Thanks,
Arthur
