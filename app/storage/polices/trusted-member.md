#Trusted Member

Access to the hackspace is based entirely on trust.
Naturally we do not feel comfortable providing keys to our space until we are comfortable that you are a trustworthy and responsible individual.
Many of our tools are dangerous in careless hands, and the trustees have a responsibility to the rest of our members to ensure their security, and the security of the space itself.

Trusted members are permitted to be keyholders, and are hence allowed to use the space 24x7.
Until you are a trusted member, you can use the space only when a trusted member is on-site, and must leave the space when they leave.

Trust is naturally a very subjective thing, but for the purposes of making this as straightforward and quick as possible:

* At least 50% of the trustees must be confident that you are responsible and trustworthy. The trustees are ultimately liable for your behaviour in the space, so this is only fair.
* We must be confident that at least the trustees know your full name, home address, and phone number, and that this information is accurate. By default, this information will be made available to other trusted members, unless you say otherwise.

The time it takes for the trustees to agree on this is not set in stone, but should typically take around a month - and often significantly less. 

Trust - and hence key holding - is also not a right, and may be taken away - though not lightly:

* At least 50% of the trustees agree that you are acting, or are suspected of acting, in a way that causes a significant issue to the hackspace: theft, abuse of other members, irresponsible use of tools or the space, intentional damage, and suchlike.

It is not compulsory to be a keyholder if you are a trusted member, if you would prefer not to have that responsibility. You are more than welcome to use the space 24x7, but need to get a set of keys 

Only trusted members are allowed to be in the space when no other trusted member is present. If you possess a set of keys and are not a trusted member, then you must hand them back to a trustee or other trusted member.
