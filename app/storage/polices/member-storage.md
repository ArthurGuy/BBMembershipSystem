#Member Storage & Ongoing Projects

Members can claim up to 19L of storage space through one or more member boxes.
The member storage boxes must be supplied by Build Brighton, this is to ensure they stack efficiently and make the most of the space available. It also simplifies enforcing of the 19L rule.

If a member is working on a larger project, something that won’t fit into a member box, then they may leave other items at the space providing they seek permission from the members first (members mailing list) and then complete and attach a Do Not Hack label to the item being left.

Approval may take a day or more so permission should be obtained in advance.
Items being left overnight or for less than 24 hours can be done so without seeking permission first providing the Do Not Hack label is completed and they are placed in a location that reduces impact to others.

Any items being left must be for a short period of time and the placement must be considerate of other members and other needs of the space. A complete and valid Do Not Hack label must be attached to the project at all times.

Any items found left on the tables, workbenches or floor that aren’t labelled should be placed into the week 1 bin, this will allow the member who may own them at least a week to reclaim them.
