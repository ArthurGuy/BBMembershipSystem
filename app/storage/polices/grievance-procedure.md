#Grievance Procedure

###Intention

The trustees have the authority to ban anyone from entering the space, and to strip anyone of their membership, but must only do so in circumstances where this is best for Build Brighton as a whole.

We will only ban repeat offenders who persistently demonstrate unwillingness to cooperate.
Throughout the process every effort will be made to keep clear and constructive communication between the trustees, the offending party, and any other affected parties.

####1. Introduction

- This policy applies to both members and non-members who use Build Brighton.
- A person may be banned from the space if they are in violation of the Rules, if they are causing persistent annoyance, or if they have the potential to harm other users of the space.
- Before the formal banning procedure is entered into, the trustees must make every reasonable attempt to resolve the issue informally.
- However, in the case of direct physical violence towards any person in the space, a member has the authority to immediately ban the offender for one month and refer the case to the trustees.

####2. Process
- The offending party must be given at least two official warnings before being banned. At every stage, it must be made clear to the party where they are in this process.
- At every stage, the trustees must be in agreement that allowing the user to continue to use the space would not be in the best interest of the organisation.
- At every stage, the trustees must make their reasoning available to the offending party.
- Each warning issued will be for a year but the trustees can raised or lower this if its if deemed suitable.
- By default, a ban will be for a year. At their discretion, the trustees can issue a reduced ban period.
- Bans of more than one year may only be issued in extreme circumstances. The trustees must review these bans yearly.
- If the offending party is a member, the ban will trigger the process to remove the member.
- When a person is banned, their right to access Build Brighton is revoked. Any entry to the space without the prior, express permission of trustees will be considered trespass.
- The trustees must seek feedback from the community to ensure this process remains fair and balanced.
- The first warning will be kept private if the offending party wishes but those who made formal complaints will be told.
- The second warning will be made public to the membership along with the reasoning for this.
