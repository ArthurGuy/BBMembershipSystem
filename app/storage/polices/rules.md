###Safety
* Don’t use power tools unless you have had a safety briefing on them first.
* Larger pieces of equipment such as the Lathe, Laser Cutter, Welder and CNC Mill require an induction and training session first.

* Check the wiki or signage for instructions first. If in doubt, ask.
* Safety equipment is available in the workshop, please use it.
* If you have an accident or injure yourself you must enter it in the accident book and notify the trustees ASAP.

###Making Decisions

###Personal Items
* Members are allowed to store personal items at the space provided they are kept in a plastic storage box on the members shelves and labelled with your name.
* Larger items can be stored for short periods but please remember space is very limited. You must contact the members mailing list for permission first and items need to be labelled with your name and the date they will be removed.

###Donating, Loaning and Borrowing Items

* If you're leaving an item that you don't want hacked for parts make sure its labelled as such.
