###Safety
* Use of the equipment at Build Brighton is entirely at your own risk
* You must check equipment before use to ensure that it is safe.
* Don’t use power tools unless you have had a safety briefing on them first.
* Larger pieces of equipment such as the Lathe, Laser Cutter, Welder and CNC Mill require an induction and training session first.
* Don't defeat or hack safety features, they are there for other people's safety as much as yours.
* Check the BBMS or signage for instructions first. If in doubt, ask.
* Safety equipment is available in the workshop, please use it.
* If you are not qualified or confident enough to use a piece of equipment you should seek advice and information from other members of the group.
* If you have an accident or injure yourself you must enter it in the accident book and notify the trustees ASAP.

###Making Decisions
* If something is broken fix it, don't complain. If you can't fix it label the equipment and post on the members mailing list or email trustees@buildbrighton.com
* If your doing something major raise it with the group responsible or ask the members mailing list or trustees first.

###Etiquette

###Personal Items
* Members are allowed to store personal items at the space provided they are kept in a plastic storage box on the members shelves and labelled with your name.
* Larger items can be stored for short periods but please remember space is very limited. You must contact the members mailing list for permission first and items need to be labelled with your name and the date they will be removed. It is your responsibility to ensure your items are always labeled.

###Donating, Loaning and Borrowing Items
* Before donating items please consider the usefulness, storage space is limited and disposal takes time. If in doubt please contact the members mailing list.

* If needed please clean/vacuum the area, especially if you have been working in the workshop.
* Place any plates, cups and cutlery in the dishwasher or wash them up.
* Any items left on the workbenches overnight becomes fair game, if you want to keep it put it away.
* If you find the space in a bad state please bring this to the attention of the membership

###Disposal
* If something is obviously trash please dispose of it.
* If you think someone else might want what you're throwing out or you don't know if it belongs to someone else please place it in the week 1 disposal box.
