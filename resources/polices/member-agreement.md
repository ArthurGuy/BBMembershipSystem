There are a few things we ask members to remember. This helps keep the space and our equipment easy for all members to use, and promotes harmony among members.

- Please return all tools and stuff you’ve used back to their proper places when done.
- Please keep all of the space clean and tidy by cleaning up any mess such as sawdust, putting things away, clearing/washing dirty dishes and throwing scrap in the bin.
- If you find a mess, it is a big help to everyone to clean and tidy. Just occasionally, someone forgets to tidy something or clean up.
- Please leave the space tidier than it was when you started work
- Before using tools, make sure you understand how to use them. Ask someone if unsure. Instruction manuals are online under each tool in "Tools and Equipment".
- Read the hazard warning notices on tools and other Build Brighton notices and heed them - they are there for a reason. Re-read them from time to time. The hazard warning notices and risk assessments are online in "Tools and Equipment".
- Some tools require an induction and a fee for use. The fee is for repairs and consumables such as new saw-blades etc and to get better tools.
- When you use a tool or any equipment, it is your responsibility to ensure it is safe. You must use it safely. You should find out about risks and how to reduce them. You must ensure bystanders are not at risk and avoid damage to the tool.
- Don’t modify tools unless agreed with the Trustees. Don’t remove guards or safety devices, interlocks or safety features as this may lead to injuries.
- If something breaks, seems dangerous or is not working properly it is very important that you tell everyone quickly so it can be fixed. See below for how to tell members.
- Please help with removal of rubbish including food waste - instructions about how to empty the bins are near each bin. If you create a lot of rubbish this is essential!
- Please be tolerant of others.
- Please remember that the Trustees and members who seem to run things may not be able to fix problems straight away. No-one has a magic wand here!
- If things aren’t right, try to avoid laying the blame. Try to help fix the problem.
- Read the BuildBrighton [rules](https://bbms.buildbrighton.com/resources/policy/rules) and follow them. This is a condition of membership.
- Please follow these maxims:
	- "Put more into the space than you take out."
	- "Make BuildBrighton friendly, welcoming and supportive!"
