#3 Week Bins

Items found in the space that aren't known Build Brighton assets and items without a Do Not Hack label on should be placed into the week 1 disposal box.
You should also post a description or a photo to the Build Brighton members mailing list.
Build Brighton assets will have a small BB logo sticker on.

The contents of each box will be shifted right at the end of the week, i.e. week 1 to week 2 and week 2 to week 3.
Items being moved out of the week 3 box should be placed into bin if they are small enough or under the table if they need to go to the tip.

Items in the week 1 and week 2 box are potentially members property and no one should take anything from them that don't belong to them, this is so the owner has time to reclaim their property.

If you want to dispose of an item but think it might be useful to other members you can place it straight into the week 2 or 3 box. Please only do this if you really think someone else wants it as we will need to dispose of it otherwise.

This system gives anyone who has left anything behind several weeks to reclaim it before it is disposed of.
