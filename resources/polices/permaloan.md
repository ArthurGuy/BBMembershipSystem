#Permaloans

_Some of the best tools at the space have been lent to us by members, and this has been a 
great way to get hold of things that we wouldn’t otherwise be able to afford. 
But it has occasionally been difficult to keep track of who lent what, when they want it back, 
and whether it’s still being used and can justify the space it takes up._

_This policy clarifies how we make decisions about obtaining items in this way._ 

Items can be loaned to Build Brighton for members to use as long as there is a need / desire for the item from the membership, 
and the space taken by the items can be justified. 

To establish this, the member should create a proposal outlining where in the space the item will live, 
how it will be installed and maintained and by who, and safety guidelines / risk assessment.

The membership will vote on the proposal but the trustees reserve the right to reject it for health and safety reasons.

If the proposal is declined the item must not be permanently left at Build Brighton and falls under the member storage rules.

The equipment must be owned by a member of Build Brighton, if they cease to be a member the equipment must be removed immediately.

Members loaning items should bear in mind that they may be damaged through misuse, accidental damage and wear and tear, 
by loaning an item the owner accepts this may occur and will assume all responsibility for it.

If equipment gets damaged or breaks, other members may attempt to repair it, if this isn’t desired the owner must 
clearly labeled the equipment reflecting this. In these situations the owner will be required to repair or 
remove the equipment within 30 days.

If the equipment is no longer of use to Build Brighton or breaks then upon request the owner will need to 
remove the equipment from the space within 30 days.

The Build Brighton trustees may request the equipment be removed immediately if health and safety or other concerns arise.

All equipment being loaned under this basis must be labelled at all times, the label needs to include the statement 
“Permaloan Item” and the owner/member’s name and contact details.

It is the responsibility of the owner/member to ensure the labeling remains intact.


_Existing permaloan items in place before this policy was introduced will be reviewed and a vote may be required 
depending on their current usage. They will still be required to comply with the labeling requirements._
