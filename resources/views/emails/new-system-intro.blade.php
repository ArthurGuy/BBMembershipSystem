    <h1>Welcome to the new Build Brighton Member System</h1>

    <p>
        You have been setup in the new Build Brighton Member System, this is where your subscription and other
        payment related things will now be managed.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can login by visiting the url below and using the password reset option, you will then be sent a link to set a password.<br />

    </p>

    <h3>Your Details</h3>
    <p>
        Please take a look at your details, I have done my best to import everything from the various places
        it used to live but some of it will probably not be right.<br />
        In addition most people are missing an emergency contact and a lot don't have an address or profile
        picture so please fill this information in.
    </p>

    <h3>Equipment Training</h3>
    <p>
        This system is also tracking equipment training, we have reasonable records for this but if you see a discrepancy
        please send me an email with the details and I will make the updates.
    </p>

    <h3>Payment Method</h3>
    <p>
        The other important thing is the payment method. This system is designed to work with direct debits as its primary method,
        this system is fully integrated and works well.<br />
        Standing orders are a pain to track and PayPal is expensive so we would like everyone with a UK bank account
        to switch over to a direct debit.<br />
        This is really easy and can be done from the member system by following the prompts.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Holders</h3>
    <p>
        If you're a key holder can you send me a quick message confirming this, some of the recent users haven't been
        recorded and I want to make sure we have accurate records.
    </p>


    <p>
        <br />
        <br />
        If you have any questions please get in touch with me or any of the other trustees.
    </p>
