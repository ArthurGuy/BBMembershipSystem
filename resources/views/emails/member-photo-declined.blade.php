    Hi {{ $user->given_name }},<br />
    I am afraid your choice of profile photo has been rejected.<br />
    Member photos are needed for identification as they allow other members to identify you.<br />
    <br />
    Please make sure the photo you upload is clear image of your face, if necessary please crop the image so your face is not to small.<br />
    Please also make sure your the only person in the image and its not to dark.<br />
    If in doubt please upload a passport style photo.<br />
    <br />
    If you require further information please email the trustees, <a href="trustees@buildbrighton.com">trustees@buildbrighton.com</a><br />
    <br />
